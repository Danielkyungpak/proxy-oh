#Proxy-oh

Originally and currently designed only for Yu-Gi-Oh, "proxy" is defined as a fake card and/or placeholder for another card. 

This app is useful for quickly creating a deck you can proxy out and playtest before you purchase the physical trading card.

#Getting Started
1. Search our database of available cards and add them to the page
2. Modify count as needed with the plus and minus buttons or in the input field itself
3. Once ready, click the "Export to PDF" button and enjoy
